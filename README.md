## My process
First, I code the entire layout using HTML semantics like divs and h1. I inserted the fonts and colors that I used in my css. After the layouts of the HTML, I started naming them with class names like, containers, title-header, accordions, text-paragraph and started designin it in css.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
